# Explicit_MPC_on_PLC
Location to store all important work related to my research on embedded explicit model predictive control on a programmable logic controller.

### General Workflow for Implementation
1. Model System Mathematically (generate a state space representation)
2. Verify implicit MPC control in Simulink
3. Generate explicit regions and verify in Simulink
4. Generate structured text with Simulink PLC Coder
5. Update Explicit_Controller Function Block accordingly
6. Run on Quad-Tank
